Muito bem decorado e aconchegante! Paula nos recebeu imensamente bem, nos deu muitas dicas e orienta\\u00e7\\u00f5es e nos deixou muito \\u00e0 vontade! Certamente \\u00e9 um local para o qual voltar\\u00edamos no futuro! Sua localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u00e9 EXCELENTE e permite que voc\\u00ea conhe\\u00e7a a maior parte da cidade a p\\u00e9 ou gastando muito pouco com transporte. Decerto que existem escadas, como a maioria dos im\\u00f3veis da cidade e que n\\u00e3o prejudica em nada a maravilhosa experi\\u00eancia. ## Fomos muito bem recebidos por Paula que foi sol\\u00edcita, simp\\u00e1tica e educada. O apartamento estava limpo, \\u00e9 jeitoso e aconchegante. Tem bons utens\\u00edlios de cozinha e artefactos para cama e banho. O \\u00fanico problema foi que as informa\\u00e7\\u00f5es sobre o apartamento n\\u00e3o inclu\\u00edam o fato de ele ficar no quarto andar com escadas irregulares e estreitas e n\\u00e3o haver interfone que permitisse abrir a porta por dentro. Tamb\\u00e9m falta ventila\\u00e7\\u00e3o. Apesar disso, no geral, foi uma boa experi\\u00eancia.  ## This place is the perfect pick. The area is very nice, close to restaurants, sights and to the train station that will get you to the beach. The apartment is spotless, calm and cosy, I recommend it most highly.  ## We loved this apartment in Lisbon. It was spacious and extremely clean.  ## The appartement is the perfect little Ikea nook hideaway but still near all the sites Lisboa has to offer. Our host was great and friendly and went beyond all expectations in making us feel welcome, also mapping us all the sites we should see while visiting. Kitchen was well equiped so it was perfect if we wanted to start our day with a little breakfast. (since I'm gluten intolrante, this was a blessing) As mentionned by other guests, yes the four flights of stairs were something after walking 15km during the day but the comfiness of the mattress was well worth it. :)  If you want the best experience in Lisboa, you got to stay here. I doubt you will be dissapointed. ## Amazing place with a great location!  It's a 4 floor walk up but it really wasn't a problem because you will be use it it once you start walking around the hilly streets of Lisbon. Everything in the apartment seemed newly renovated and clean. I would highly recommend this place! ## I wish my apartment in Dublin was as nice as this one. The apartment is gorgeous, bigger than we expected from the photos, located close to great bars and restaurants, 2 minutes stroll to the Time Out Market and despite being in a busy area was quiet even at night. <br/>Our flight to Lisbon was delayed over 3hours and despite this caused no problems with our hosts, who provided great recommendations for the city. <br/>Our best airbnb so far.  ## Strongly recommend this place. Located in a very vibrant area this new flat is very clean and funcional. The communication with the host was great, the check in was super easy and everyone was very friendly.  ## Un agr\\u00e9able s\\u00e9jour, l'appartement est tr\\u00e8s beau, l'emplacement est id\\u00e9al proche du m\\u00e9tro ainsi que des quartiers tendances. Je vous le conseille vivement !!!! ## Top location for City Break! ## gostei bastante do apartamento ## L'appartamento \\u00e8 davvero bello come nelle foto, e si trova proprio in centro a due passi dalla metro, treno e battelli. Inoltre si trova vicinisso al Mercado di Ribeira \\\"TIME OUT MARKET\\\" ottimo per fare le colazioni o per mangiare. Alejandro \\u00e8 una persona squisita e ci ha molto aiutato. Consigliamo l'appartamento a tutti coloro che vogliono vivere e visitare Lisbona.  ## Ivan's place is very central in a very cool part of Lisboa. Walking distance to lots of restaurants and bars. Lots of public transport around as well.<br/>The place is very clean and modern and has great amenities like a washer, a dishwasher and coffee machine. Everything you need!<br/>The 4 floor walk up is intense, but he is very open about it in his profile and this is common in most buildings in Lisbon.<br/>Obrigado Ivan and Paula! ## This apartment is very clean and comfortable. Felt a little bit like a hotel instead of a local homestay. Comfortable bed and enough space to store luggage and so on. <br/><br/>Unfortunately not to airy (we had 30degrees in june) and no air-conditioning provided (only fan). No look out on the street.<br/><br/>Nevertheless a pleasant stay <br/><br/> ## The apartment is perfect ! Very clean. Close to everything so very central. Only minor point if u you cannot walk that good, than dont choose this apartment because of the many stairs u have to walk up. Other than that the place is perfect ! ## It was good location<br/>Good decor but the smell was terrible if the duct could open the window . It was super hot . ## Sch\\u00f6ne und saubere Wohnung in bester Lage (bequem zu Fuss um Bairo Alto und zum Hauptbahnhof Cais do Sodr\\u00e9). Die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Einziger Schwachpunkt: An heissen Tagen kann man schlecht l\\u00fcften aufgrund eines Gestanks der von unterhalb der Fenster zu kommen scheint. ## Paula and Ivan's place is the perfect place to stay as a couple in Lisbon. <br/><br/>Located in a perfect spot in downtown right by the river and timeout market place where you can get any cuisine your heart desires. <br/><br/>It was super easy communicating with Paula and the apartment was even nicer than the photos. <br/><br/>All in all a fantastic place and if we were to come back we'd stay again.  ## We hebben 12 hele fijne dagen gehad in het appartement! Het bed was comfortabel en groot, de badkamer luxe en er was zelfs een wasmachine aanwezig. Bij aankomst kregen we gelijk een kaart van Lissabon, een mapje met allemaal informatie en er lag al een fles water voor ons koud in de koelkast. Daarnaast was er een goed koffiesetapparaat aanwezig en lagen er al koffiecups; super fijn! Omdat wij 12 dagen blijven had ik gevraagd of we op de helft nieuwe handdoeken mochten, dezelfde dag nog hadden we een tas met schone handdoeken aan de deur hangen :)! <br/>Wel is het jammer dat het raam op een binnenplaatsje kijkt waardoor je geen uitzicht hebt. Daarnaast werkte de wifi alleen in de keuken en niet in de woonkamer en slaapkamer. Maar dat was eigenlijk het enige... <br/>Zeker een aanrader! ## Logement tr\\u00e8s bien situ\\u00e9 et fonctionnel. <br/>H\\u00f4te accueillant et serviable !! ## Die Wohnung ist modern eingerichtet und sehr sauber! Wir hatten als junges P\\u00e4rchen eine tolle Woche in der zentral gelegenen Wohnung. In der N\\u00e4he sind einige Bars und man ist im wenigen Minuten am Bahnhof. <br/>Wir kamen sp\\u00e4t Abends an und wurden sehr freundlich empfangen. Eine Flasche Wasser stand im K\\u00fchlschrank bereit und auch ein kleiner Ventilator, wor\\u00fcber wir sehr froh waren. Das einzige was etwas schade ist, ist das es in der Wohnung sehr schw\\u00fcl ist und man nicht richtig l\\u00fcften kann. <br/>Die Kommunikation mit Alex war freundlich und unkompliziert, vielen Dank f\\u00fcr den sch\\u00f6nen Aufenthalt! :) ## Great service and very easy to communicate with. Thanks for lending us your flat :) ## A great apartment in a really nice area of lisbon.

Der check-in sowie die Kommunikation waren ebenso problemlos. Wir hatten einen sch\\u00f6nen Aufenthalt! ## The apartment is centrally located, near the Bica elevador. Nearby there is a supermarket and pharmacy, and tram / bus stops to Commerce Square / Rossio.<br/>Paula and her daughter Alexia have been very kind and have worked hard to solve a small inconvenience we had,  even though it was not caused by them.<br/>Recommended! ## Fijn verblijf gehad! ## Um apartanento ultra limpo, agradavel, bem equipado com 01 janela.

Das Bett super. Negativ war, dass die Wohnung im 4. Stock liegt und nur 2 Fenster in einen kleinen Lichtschacht hat. ## We were very happy with the apartment. Very central, clean, cosy and comfortable. Recomended. <br/>Thank you. ## On the whole, the flat is lovely. It is brilliantly located, is a good size, modern and was very clean. However, because the flat occupies the back half of the building (I think the flat would originally have taken up the whole floor, but has been divided to make two flats) there is very little natural light. The only windows look onto a concrete light shaft running down the back of the building. Not a huge problem, but made dropping back in the day a little unappealing. The divide also meant that we could hear every single word the girls in the front flat said - when they got in late, when they used the shower, switched lights on and off - it was like they were staying in our flat (in fact, there was a locked door adjoining the two flats which could account for the poor sound insulation). A couple of times one of them got in late and so buzzed the buzzer at 4am -  the buzzer goes off in both flats, so we weren't very impressed. Location and the standard of the furnishings were brilliant - it's a shame about the noise levels. There are also lots of stairs so don't pick this one if you're not prepared to climb! ## V\\u00e4ldigt v\\u00e4lst\\u00e4dad o trevlig l\\u00e4genhet p\\u00e5 fj\\u00e4rde v\\u00e5ning utan hiss i lugnt omr\\u00e5de men \\u00e4nd\\u00e5 n\\u00e4ra till allt o g\\u00e5ngavst\\u00e5nd till centrum. <br/>Bekv\\u00e4m s\\u00e4ng o fr\\u00e4scht badrum, stort k\\u00f6k med kaffemaskin och diskmaskin. <br/>Enda nackdelen \\u00e4r att det inte finns f\\u00f6nster ut mot gatan s\\u00e5 k\\u00e4ndes lite inst\\u00e4ngt. ## \\u623f\\u4e1c\\u56de\\u590d\\u4fe1\\u606f\\u5f88\\u53ca\\u65f6\\u3002\\u623f\\u95f4\\u8bbe\\u65bd\\u5f88\\u5b8c\\u5584\\uff0c\\u4f4f\\u8d77\\u6765\\u5f88\\u8212\\u9002\\u3002\\u623f\\u95f4\\u5f88\\u5e72\\u51c0\\u6574\\u9f50\\u3002\\u516c\\u5bd3\\u4f4d\\u7f6e\\u5f88\\u597d\\uff0c\\u516c\\u4ea4\\u7ad9\\u706b\\u8f66\\u7ad9\\u5730\\u94c1\\u7ad9\\u90fd\\u5f88\\u8fd1\\u3002\\u5f88\\u63a8\\u8350\\u3002\\u552f\\u4e00\\u4e0d\\u8db3\\u5c31\\u662f\\u6ca1\\u6709\\u666f\\u53ef\\u4ee5\\u770b\\uff0c\\u4e0d\\u8fc7\\u6ca1\\u5173\\u7cfb\\u53cd\\u6b63\\u90fd\\u662f\\u5929\\u9ed1\\u4e86\\u624d\\u56de\\u53bb\\u7684\\u3002 ## Great place for stay in Lisbon. Walking distance to Metro and Time Out Market. Great host in terms of communication and amenities provided. ## Great stay. The location is awesome for just being able to walk around and central enough to see a lot on foot. There are a lot of nice tapas bars and restaurants along with a huge market that\\u2019s maybe a 4 minute walk. Would stay here again for sure. ## Beautiful place, centrally located close to the waterfront and a very kind and responsive host ## A lovely place for a lovely stay in Lisbon, very close to the hypercentre of the city, its restaurants, shops and transports. The apartment itself is very nice, comfy and kept clean. It only suffers from a poor noise isolation with the other appartment next door, not too annoying but still noticeable. <br/>The rent is on the fourth floor of the building with no lift : not a problem for everybody but best to know before ordering. <br/>We were welcomed by Alexia, very friendly and helpful. They are always available and prepared a few tips for your stay. We enjoyed ours and recommend the place ! ## Super accueil de Navi dans ce logement tr\\u00e8s bien situ\\u00e9, bien \\u00e9quip\\u00e9 et propre. Il faut cependant noter qu'il y a 4 \\u00e9tages \\u00e0 monter \\u00e0 pied ce qui pourrait poser probl\\u00e8me pour certaines personnes. De plus, l'appartement est tr\\u00e8s sombre car il ne dispose que de 2 fen\\u00eatres donnant sur un mur juste en face... ## This Airbnb is nicely designed with wood flooring throughout, a beautiful bathroom, and a comfortable bed.<br/><br/>The \\u2018\\u2019living nook\\u2019\\u2019 is great for reading.<br/><br/>The WiFi is spotty- it goes in and out every 20 minutes or so and then it reconnects. Its about 12mbps/12mbps when it\\u2019s running but I found it to be inconsistent. This could be due to the construction happening downstairs. The construction is intense some days (written 06/22/18), to the point where my Bose headphones canceled out the noise but the ground and walls were shaking from their saws / jackhammers / etc.<br/><br/>In the bathroom, the overhead elephant shower is awesome. However the way the shower is designed it leaks out into the main area of the bathroom quickly so watch for that so you don\\u2019t have water everywhere.<br/><br/>In the summer months, the bedroom can be quite warm at night and there is no proper AC in the unit so I used the fan provided in the closet.<br/><br/>The kitchen is well stocked and had everything I needed to make meals. ## Tolle Wohnung in einer super sch\\u00f6nen Gegend. Es gibt viele kleine L\\u00e4den, Bars und Caf\\u00e9s drum herum. Das Apartment ist schick eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Ich w\\u00fcrde hier jederzeit wieder buchen. Danke f\\u00fcr alles! :) ## appartement au 4\\u00b0 \\u00e9tages avec des marches tr\\u00e8s hautes!! appartement assez bruillant et immeuble enti\\u00e8rement en travaux avec beaucoup de bruits des 8 heure du matin. Si non conforme et avec le confort d'usage. ## Very good location, in a quiet area, close to Lisbon Downtown and a couple of blocks away from a really cheap parking. Everything was new in the apartment and it was fully equipped. Nice value!  ## Good, recently renovated and clean apartment (4th floor) at an A-location for my 10 day stay: the elevador da Bica, bars at the pink street, Adamastor miradouro (unfortunately closed at the moment for maintance), Time out market, supermarket mini preco, metro station Cais do Sodr\\u00e9 all within 5-10 min walking distance. Right in the heart of many of Lisbon's beautiful characteristics. I had a lovely check-in with Goncalo: nice and open approach. I would definitely recommend a stay at this apartment to anyone. ## Very nice and tidy place! Great location. ## Very modern flat which has everything you need. Alexia is also very nice and provided us with a lot of tips for Lissabon. We totally recommend this place. ## Alloggio elegante e ben curato. Tutto ok e assistenza perfetta. Ottima la posizione per raggiungere qualsiasi parte della citt\\u00e0. Tutto vicino: trasporti, market e locali vari. Peccato solo per i 4 piani senza ascensore e l'affaccio su una stretta tromba interna allo stabile. Consigliabile. ## Lo que mejor rescatamos de este lindo departamento (id\\u00e9ntico a las fotos) es su ubicaci\\u00f3n. Cerca al metro y al centro. Lo que nos permiti\\u00f3 conocer y desplazarnos con facilidad. Cansa un poco subir las escaleras, pero una vez dentro del departamento te olvidas de lo que sucede en el exterior. Una cocina completa y con algunos insumos para aderezar nuestras comidas. Implementos de limpieza, y hasta caf\\u00e9 para los d\\u00edas de nuestra estad\\u00eda... Much\\u00edsimas gracias! ## Flott,moderne leilighet i gammel leieg\\u00e5rd, sentralt i Lisboa. Stille omgivelser, kort vei til  t-banestasjon og togstasjon, til bysentrum og den vakre elvebredden, samt en mengde restauranter. <br/>Hyggelig mottakelse med nyttige tips ang. valg av severdigheter.<br/>Topp utgangspunkt for fine dager i Lisboa. ## Toller Aufenthalt :) <br/>Sehr nette Gastgeberin , die schnell und zuverl\\u00e4ssig geantwortet hat. <br/>Super Ausstattung und sehr sauber! ## Great location which was best for us although 4 flights of stairs to get up and down (No lift). The flat is small but nice and has a good feel to it and looks as the photos although the windows don\\u2019t look out to anything (inner sort of courtyard). <br/>All in all really good. ## Great apartment, very clean and left nice touches like a bottle of wine and tea and coffee. It is up the top of some steep stairs which was fine for us, but might not be for everyone. ## The apartment is clean, tidy and nicely decorated. It is located in a quiet street and all the necessary facilities are nearby. Metro station Cais do Sodre is ten minutes walk. Apartement is on the fourth floor and the stairs leading up to apartment  are narrow and steep so it can create a problem with a large suitcases. This apartment is separated from the neighboring apartment by the door so you can hear the conversation from the neighboring apartment. ## Todo fue genial. alexia nos recibi\\u00f3 perfectamente, incluso hubo en la reserva un error, pusimos que viajaba un solo hu\\u00e9sped y \\u00e9ramos tres, y no puso ning\\u00fan problema.  Lo \\u00fanico a mejorar bajo mi punto de vista es que el agua se sale much\\u00edsimo de la ducha. Vendr\\u00eda muy bien una mampara porque ten\\u00edamos que estar recogiendo constantemente el agua que sal\\u00eda. Gracias por todo Alexia ## Super logement merci pour l'accueil. ## Tr\\u00e8s bel appartement, spacieux et bien agenc\\u00e9. Proximit\\u00e9 du centre ville (5 min a pied). Commerces (Bar, restaurants, supermarket, march\\u00e9) a quelques m\\u00e8tres de l'immeuble. Environnement tranquille. H\\u00f4te accueillant et r\\u00e9actif. A recommander : une tr\\u00e8s belle adresse a Lisbonne. ## Stayed for a week. The apartment is in a great location close to the market, and lots of bars and restos. The apartment is on the 4th floor so lots of stairs to kind in mind and not lit at night either. The apartment is modern and well appointed. As others have said they need to fix the shower you can really only use the non-waterfall one and you have to point it in the left corner if you don't want water everywhere. Alexia was very nice and check-in was easy, thanks! ## Tem tudo que um hotel possa oferecer, mas com custo baixo \\u00e9 uma melhor localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o! Fica pr\\u00f3ximo de pontos tur\\u00edsticos e do metr\\u00f4 que possibilita fazer varios passeios a p\\u00e9!

Enfim, excelente atendimento, localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o, acomoda\\u00e7\\u00e3o, mas, apenas o defeito de subir escadas com as malas (o que n\\u00e3o foi um problema pois j\\u00e1 sab\\u00edamos antes de locarmos)<br/>Valeu a pena!<br/>Rafa e Rafa ## Navi \\u00e8 stata molto disponibile e gentile! ha soddisfatto le<br/>nostre richieste! consiglio a tutti! ## Nice flat, perfect location near the city centre and a good position also for the metro!! ## good location ## \\u0423\\u0434\\u043e\\u0431\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f \\u043a\\u0443\\u0445\\u043d\\u044f \\u0441\\u043e \\u0432\\u0441\\u0435\\u043c\\u0438 \\u043f\\u0440\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430\\u0434\\u043b\\u0435\\u0436\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044f\\u043c\\u0438. \\u041e\\u0442\\u043b\\u0438\\u0447\\u043d\\u043e\\u0435 \\u0440\\u0430\\u0441\\u043f\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435 \\u0432 \\u0441\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u043c \\u0446\\u0435\\u043d\\u0442\\u0440\\u0435 \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430. ## Stylish place in a great location, apartment is only for rentals, it is not a 'lived-in' apartment. Very clean. On the fourth floor..so count on strengthening your leg muscles...but hey Lisbon hilly anyway! ## Very nice and clean place, in a perfect spot near nightlife and sights. Still quiet at night. ## Would really recommend staying here, well located in the old town with cool restaurants and bars within 2 minutes walk ## Tr\\u00e8s reactive ## Navi's place was so great! Great location and great apartment. Only concern is the 4 flights of stairs to get into the apartment, but other than that perfect! ## Top Apartment und super Gastgeber. Wir kamen mit dem Mietwagen an und fragten ob sie uns einen g\\u00fcnstigen Parkplatz empfehlen k\\u00f6nnten, wo wir den Wagen 4 Tage stehen lassen k\\u00f6nnten. Sie hat dann extra etwas herausgesucht f\\u00fcr 3\\u20ac/Tag und als wir ankamen hat sie uns sogar dorthin gef\\u00fchrt, indem sie uns mit ihrem Auto vorausgefahren ist, weil sie meinte dass der Parkplatz schwierig zu finden sei.<br/><br/>Das Apartment ist super sch\\u00f6n und edel, hat eine optimale Lage und nachts ist es dennoch sch\\u00f6n leise. Das Bett ist super bequem und alles war tip top sauber!<br/>Leider gab es nur zwei Fenster in einen Innenhof/Schacht, wodurch nicht so viel frische Luft und Tageslicht in die Wohnung kommt. Aber da wir sowieso viel unterwegs waren hat uns das nichts ausgemacht. ## G<br/>Nice flat ## fully equipped appartment in a perfect location.<br/>we didnt like the smell of the appartment anf it is very hot and hard to get some air in. there is a lot of light in the bedroom so we didnt sleep well ## Apartamento ideal en el coraz\\u00f3n de Lisboa ## Appartement calme et tr\\u00e8s bien situ\\u00e9, bon accueil. Salle de bains et cuisine un peu dat\\u00e9es. ## Ha sido todo perfecto, nada qu\\u00e9 objetar ## Navi & Alexia's place is just as described. It's really good, and I will repeat in the near future for sure. Highly recommended if you want to stay near Lisbon's best touristic zones. And I would like to add the great communication from the hosts, anytime I needed something, they were there for me, and that's what we all expect from any host. Thank you so much! ## A fantastic, modern and clean place close to plenty of bars and restaurants (including the Time Out Market which was great!) as described and everything is within walking distance including train station very close by. Host was fantastic, met us at the apartment with a map and gave us lots of recommendations of what to do during our stay - they even helped to organise a taxi to pick us up from the airport which was very helpful! As mentioned in other reviews, there are a LOT of stairs up to the apartment and would not be suitable for those who find it harder to walk and would not be fun to lug staircases up them! ## Great location was very close to everything. The place was super clean. If you plan to stay in this place and have any sort of mobility disability I recommend you to speak to the host since the place has a lot of stairs. ## Awesome space, would recommend. ## It is a clean appartment. Close to the old center and metro. ## Everything was perfect and the host is very accomodating. We were able to leave our bags and leave a bit later to enjoy the city before we left! We also had a map with all the sites to visit. thanks again ## This place is a great location -- we have never had to walk more than 15-20 minutes to see the main attractions of Lisbon. The main market square is within 5-6 mins walk. The apartment is sparkingly clean and has all the amenities that you might need over the stay. The only drawback was that the internet does not work all the time -- you need to restart the router at least few times a week. However, I strongly recommend this apartment in an excellent location! ## Todo perfecto. Limpieza muy buena e instalaciones y mobiliario nuevo. <br/>Muy recomendable para pasar unos d\\u00edas en Lisboa .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "this is a very cozy and comfortable house to stay in.never worry about the safety and the host is very nice.very close to parque metro station.easy to find. ## good<br/> ## My first hostel experience, and all I have to say is it will be pretty hard to beat this place!_x000D_<br/>I booked a room for 6 people, and I ended up getting my own room (there's a locker for each person in the room as well) so I knew my belongings were safe since I was the only one with a key card for my room. There's a 5 euro deposit for the keycard, so don't lose it!_x000D_<br/>The bed was more comfortable than mine at home, and if you close the curtains & shades it tunes out any cars driving by._x000D_<br/>You can't ask for a better location, I could see the Parque metro station from my window (the hostel is on the first floor of a really pretty building). The metro was so convenient, it came every 4-5 minutes, or you could go to the many local cafes right outside, or just walk for about 15-20 minutes down the street to get to all the fancy clothing boutiques._x000D_<br/>Free breakfast was great, the kitchen looks even better than it does in the picture; brand new!_x000D_<br/>I arrived in Lisbon around 8am, and they let me store all my belongings there before I even checked in, and I kept them there until evening after I had already checked out and it was 100% safe._x000D_<br/>The bathrooms are constantly being kept clean since there's a reception person to help 24/7._x000D_<br/>There's laundry facilities, the linens are super soft, the TV room is great, and the bathrooms are so luxurious!_x000D_<br/>Thanks Zabed for hosting me, you went above and beyond!_x000D_<br/> ## Das Hostel war neu und deshalb funktionierte alles tadellos: Schnelles W-Lan, stabile Hochbetten mit gemütlichen Matratzen, neue Badezimmer mit richtig heißem und starkem Wasser (was für Lissabon nicht selbstverständlich ist!)._x000D_<br/>Das Frühstück war sehr grundlegend, aber für den Nachpreis OK. _x000D_<br/>Direkt gegenüber befindet sich die Metro-Station \"Parque\" und man kommt mit der blauen Linie in nur 3 Stationen in´s Zentrum._x000D_<br/>Sicherlich gibt es zentralerer Hotels mit mehr Extras, aber für den Preis gibt es keinen Grund zur Beschwerde! _x000D_<br/>Danke für den unkomplizierten Aufenthalt! ## It was fine for a dorm, but I think for the people staying there are far too less bathrooms and toilets. so you could stand in line. ## Our stay in Lisbon Tip Hostel was very good. The mixed rooms were well cleaned and cosy. There was even a kitchen which we could use whenever we wanted to. It's a perfect place for young people who like meeting new people. ## Close to shops in town and a comfortable place to stay!  ## Young and friendly staff. Great location along the metro line. A good place to meet people at the kitchen table, especially in the morning. The only thing I did not like was that there was a crazy guy in my room, jumping around and talking to himself for most of the night. But that's not the staff's fault ! He only stayed one day so no worries, he won't be tehre anymore ! :-) ## The place is just off the Parque metro stop which is great. The staff is very friendly.  The people staying there were cool and pretty respectful.  The hostel has a nice size kitchen. Small garbage can in the kitchen means bags of garbage sitting around. Be aware that the dorm rooms are on the street and its noisy. Also people come and go all night ringing the door bell. That too is really loud. There are only 2 bathrooms, toilets in with the baths/showers. So getting up early or showering late at night is optimal. If you have to use the toilet, plan to be waiting in line in the AM. But the place is nice. The people are nice and helpful. Location is a 20 min walk to center.  Great for the price! ## Had a nice stay at this hostel. The beds were comfortable. I think the WC could be a bit more clean tho. ## Well located and clean. ## Good value for money. ## Good stay with reasonable price ## Very Nice. ## Bonne auberge pour les jeunes ## Un lugar muy recomendado, esta muy bien ubicado y el precio es bastante barato sin duda me quedaría ahí de nuevo ## The real problem of this hostel is the lack of an air conditioning. The building is situated at noisy street, so you have to choose if you want 40 degrees inside or 30 degrees + fumes. It's really hard to sleep in these conditions but staff is very kind. ## Everything is correct, like the photos said. But it is important to know that the kitchen is close from 22 a.p. till 8 a.m.<br/>Regards. ## Je trouve le logement cher pour une auberge de jeunesse, 78€ la nuit c’est excessif pour ce que c’est et surtout pour dormir avec des inconnus!<br/>Après ce fût une solution par dépit car suite à un souci avec un logement nous nous sommes retrouvés à la rue (mes parents de 70 ans, une amie et moi).. nous avons donc apprécié de pouvoir trouver une telle solution plutôt qu’une nuit dans la rue!!!!! <br/>Je tiens à souligner la politesse et la gentillesse des 2 employés à la réception! ## Beside to big street and park.<br/>You can find the door between the car shop.<br/>Near to metro, bus stations.<br/><br/>Little bit noisy because of traffic at night, but I didn’t care about it.<br/><br/>Clean kitchen, bathroom and included breakfast (freaks, toast, coffee, juice )<br/><br/>Good location and good access.<br/>I’ll use this hostel next time again. ## A little bit far from the city centre, but nice staff. Clean parts. ## Awesome place ## Bem localizado, estação de metro atravessando a rua e paradas de ônibus (auto carro) perto. O local tem um responsável durante 24h para liberar a entrada no apartamento e com certeza é o melhor custo benefício da região. ## The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. ## Convenient location. Clean hostel. Would stay again ## Minha estadia foi quando estava comecando o surto do Corona mas mesmo assim fui bem recebida e tratada. O hostel é suoee aconchegante, em frente a estação do metrô \"parque\" e perto de pontos turísticos, shopping e todo tipo de transporte e supermecados. ## You have to be there ## Ambiente acolhedor com uma localização excelente. Custo-benefício muito bom! ## Estão de parabéns super indico. ## Great stay! Would recommend ## Un lugar muy acogedor, buen lugar donde hospedarse, muy limpio, muy organizado todo, 100% seguro y está cerca de todo, es cerca del metro lo cual hace más eficiente todo, 100% recomendado ## Nice time and nice place where you can rest and meet a new friends!!! ## Great location and very good communication ## É um excelente espaço próximo ao Marquês de Pombal. Tem uma boa apresentação e limpeza. Os hóspedes que se encontram na casa são educados e fraternos. ## Очень хороший хостел !!! ## Очень хороший хостел ! ## Отличный хостел, советую ! ## Super accueil, chambre propre ## Typische lisbon wohnung, in der ich selbst gern wohnen würde. ## top ## Es muy cómodo y la atención es increíble ## Très bon emplacement et tout le monde est sympa. Merci beaucoup😊 ## Fiquei hospedado do hostel por 23 dias, ambiente tranquilo, limpo e organizado, o atendimento excelente, pra quem vem do 🇧🇷 recomendo muito.. ótimo custo benefício e localização.. vale muito a pena ## Amazing hostel, clean and calm with everything you need for a short stay. ## Very kind host, a nice shared area, big kitchen and terrace. Comfortable bed and clean bath. ## The property is absolutely clean and stylish. It is exactly the same as shown in the pictures and within walking distances to various attractions. ## Great place to stay in lissabon!! ## Lovely stay! Thanks so much :) ## Personnes très agréable et très attentionné pour notre bien être, je les remercie car j'ai pu passé un très agréable séjour dans un lieu très bien situé. ## Fantastic place, I felt in home! 🤓\n"

Really reactive host to solve problems ## Everything was great and as advertised, except the wifi can be spotty at times. ## A brilliant compact places to explore Lisbon from, in a fantastic location with all you need for your stay. ## The location of the apartment is very good, you can walk to all restaurants, bars and to the downtown. The apartment is very small (which was ok) but it is very dark. the windows face an inner courtyard where hardly any daylight comes in. But what was worst of our stay: The drain in the shower stank badly, the air conditioning also - if you turned it on - stank. in addition, moisture has accumulated in the apartment far too quickly. Once we used the water heater to make a tea and immediately everything was damp in the apartment. either you had to open the windows (then it was freezing cold in the apartment) or you had to turn on the smelly air conditioning. the bed was also very uncomfortable. we can not recommend the apartment because price-performance ratio is BAD! ## Best place to stay for Some days in lisbon. <br/>Everything was perfekt for ist\\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffd ## Small but clean studio situated in a great area of Lisbon! ## Carla was really comunicative and helpful.

Perfect for a couple or 1 person.<br/>The area has a lot to offer:  lots of cafe's, restaurants and shops. The main shopping street is at 5/10 minutes walk and the city center is about 18 minutes walk.<br/>Communication with the host is good and via message.<br/><br/>The only problem we had was the hairdryer: it didn't work.<br/>We tried to ask the owner if we could have a new one, but didn't help us much.<br/>We had to buy a new one and brought it back with us.<br/><br/>The check-in procedure consist in picking up the keys from a locker box really close to the apartment (50 meters). The host will send your personal code for the locker.<br/>On the day of the check-out you just need to return the keys in the locker box.<br/><br/>We had a lovely stay in Lisbon! ## Carla a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 super en terme de communication.

Thank you Jorge. ## For me and my family, this was our first experience in AirBNB._x000D_<br/>We stayed 14 days in Jorge Matos's apartment at Paco De Arcos in Portugal. Jorge's apartment, as is described in AirBNB, \\\"stays 250 meters from the beach (3 minutes walking) and just 15 minutes by car from Lisbon, Cascais and Sintra. Ideal for beach holidays and for discovering fantastic places.\\\"_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Yet not enough to describe all the other great advantages:_x000D_<br/>* The whole area is very well located, both to move with  public transportation or by car._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>* Beautiful beaches, shopping malls, and good services (everything we need)._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>* The apartment is well equipped to the smallest of details, and covered all we needed in our stay._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>But the big advantage is Jorge and Milla:_x000D_<br/>We've been helped, advised, and they offers us their friendship._x000D_<br/>This kindness and personal service, wouldn't be received in any hotel in the world!_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>We liked it a lot! And we highly recommend it!!! ## Encantados con el anfitri\\u00f3n y el alojamiento !_x000D_<br/>Los d\\u00edas que pasamos en casa de Jorge fueron geniales._x000D_<br/>El piso est\\u00e1 bien ubicado, en una zona tranquila y bien comunicada, realmente es como lo describe.

We had a problem with the internet and he sorted it out immediately. He even picked us up from the airport when we arrived. The flat/apartment is in a great location - 10 minutes walk from the train station on the line to Lisbon and Cascais, only a few minutes from a supermarket/grocery store and the beach and there are also nice restaurants really close by. We had a great meal at the local restaurant Quitanda (on the way to the beach walking through the estate - next to the Pharmacist). The train gets to Lisbon in just 20 minutes. The portable wifi provided works great and is very useful. The apartment/flat has everything that you need - even beach towels provided. You can hear the train from the flat - but shutting the windows and pulling down the blinds cuts out most of the noise from outside the building. There is an air conditioner in the living room - although we didn't need to use it as you can get a nice breeze through the flat/apartment when you open the windows. We highly recommend going to Poets Park - its a huge park with lots of little gardens dedicated to different poets - very unique and very nice to wander through and explore. ## Ces vacances en famille se sont tr\\u00e8s bien pass\\u00e9es \\u00e0 Pa\\u00e7o de Arcos et dans le logement de Jorge.<br/>L'appartement est id\\u00e9alement situ\\u00e9 dans la ville et la ville dans un environnement riche de paysages et visites (Lisbonne, Sintra, Cascais...).

From booking the apartment, at short notice, until we left they were very helpful. <br/>The apartment was a 2 minute walk to the beach which we loved and within easy reach of some great restaurants. <br/>A lovely place to stay to discover Pa\\u00e7o de Arcos. ## Jorge and Mila are great hosts: from the first contact by email to the last goodbye at the airport (Jorge picked us up and dropped us at the airport, what a service). The appartment is great with nice furniture, clean kitchen and bathroom, nice bedrooms and a small balcony. Very close to the beach (with a nice view on the Atlantic Ocean and Lissabon), shops and restraurants are a few steps away; the railway station to Lissabon or Cascais is on 10 minutes walk. Because of this, and especially the hospitality of Jorge and Mila, we had a really great time in Portugal, a country we start to love now. Thanks for all Jorge and Mila, you were (and are) great!<br/>Best regards, Jeroen, Jacqueline and Miguel ## Awesome host, place was amazing, central to everything, mini-preco, train station and beach.  Nearby restaurants were good value for money and the local food was good.  All necessary items were provided. ## Jorge is een geweldige gastheer! Hij is erg vriendelijk, attent en behulpzaam. <br/>Het appartement is heel centraal gelegen, in een voorstadje van Lissabon, in een buurt met appartementen complexen. Wij hebben er geen toeristen gezien. Supermarkt is om de hoek, vlakbij het strand en op prima loopafstand van het station. Goede uitvalsbasis om Lissabon te bezoeken en de dorpen aan de kust zoals Cascais en Estoril. <br/>In het appartement is alles aanwezig wat je nodig hebt. ## Appartement spacieux, propre, tr\\u00e8s bien \\u00e9quip\\u00e9, \\u00e0 cot\\u00e9 de la plage.Jorge est tr\\u00e8s sympa et r\\u00e9actif.

About the location: near the beach, supermarket, near the municipal market, within walking distance of the beautiful Park of Poets.  About the host: Jorge is a wonderful host, responsive and attentive, we are glad to meet him and are grateful for the hospitality! ## Jorge est un tr\\u00e8s bon h\\u00f4te Airbnb, on pouvait le contacter en cas de question, tr\\u00e8s facilement.

I  was correct about Martin and the apartment. He was quick to communicate about the reservation and is a terrific owner/manager. The apartment is as good as it looks. The neighborhood is very central and typical in Lisbon. Rossio train station is 3 minute walk, the airport bus stop about a 5 minute walk.  The apartment is furnished well and has been updated. The views are as wonderful as they look in the photos because the apartment is at the top of the building and you'll walk 61 stairs to get to it. It's worth it.  ## Communication with Martin was clear and precise. His colleague Andre met us at the apartment and showed us around and was there to answer any questions we had about the flat or the area._x000D_<br/>(There was a nice bottle of wine to welcome us too.)_x000D_<br/>It's a great apartment in a nice part of town. There's several flights of stairs to climb but the view is worth it. We'd stay here again. ## This apartment is in a great location, between the Baixa / Chiado and Bairro Alto areas. Within a short walk of those areas, supermarket and the metro. Great views of the castle and over the city from the kitchen. ## Thanks for the stay in your apartment. It was perfectly situated and the view was worth every stair. The apartment had everything we needed. ## Posizione della casa ottima, nel centro della citt\\u00e0. Casa pulita e ben ordinata !!

Jorge compensam. <br/>Recomendo muito!! ## This was my second time in the apartment. The view and location is outstanding. The stairs keep you humble and adds to the experience. The reception was really good and the apartment above all else was clean. ## Excellent host, apartment with a great location, close to the city, with most amenities and wonderful views. Don't be put off by the 62 steps between the street and the front door of the apartment! I have no hesitation recommending the apartment and would love to return myself, in the future. ## Good location. Be prepared to walk uphill and up stairs. View is nice, however can't really sit and enjoy it with the layout. Windows don't all have coverings so felt a bit exposed at times. Hot water required lighting a pilot light. Had a lot of trouble with this since I'm not used to it. Wifi was slow but mostly functional. Kitchen pans were not clean and I had to scrub everything beforehand. No pans, only pots available. Thorough check in process. Run by a company called diva apartments. ## Martin/Paulo, foram muito atenciosos. O apto tem otima localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o,  pr\\u00f3ximo a tudo. Gostamos muito .<br/> ## Martin's place was a great base to explore Lisbon. The 62 steps are not so bad, really, and the view is worth it as everyone says. <br/>Even though the neighborhood is very central (convenient to Rossio train station and lots of the main downtown tourist areas) we found it quiet at night -- a nice surprise. We found we could walk everywhere we wanted to go.<br/>It's a quirky layout and it's decorated to feel like a real home, not like some spare/spartan \\\"design\\\" Airbnbs. And it was spotless.<br/>Check-in was a dream with Martin's business partner Paulo, who took the time to show us everything about the apartment (it has a funky old gas hot water heating system) and talk to us about the area. Super professional and friendly. We had a great stay! ## Amazing/perfect location with great views from kitchen. Very friendly/helpful host. Good value for money.  ## great location and great place. amazing views! ## This is one of Airbnb's best apartments in Lisboa. Clean and tidy exactly like-for-like as the pictures, great host and good communication. Travelling to the city center was on walking distance, as well as the supermarket which was really convenient. I was with a party of three people, we all had a great days out and comfortable nights in. We would definitely stay again. Thank you Paulo and Martin!  ## Martin's apartment was just as you see on the photos! Location is just perfect, everything in within walking distance (5-20 minutes). Spectacular view from the windows, the sunrise was absolutely amazing! Very clean and comfortable place. Martin was a great host, he waited for us at the apartment, even if we arrived late in the evening and he was very kind to give many recomendations where to go, where to eat. Thank you Martin! We had a great time!!!  ## L'appartement est super bien situ\\u00e9 et tr\\u00e8s bien \\u00e9quip\\u00e9. L'accueil est chaleureux ## perfect location, and very nice hosts.<br/>because of the perfect location it can be noisy, so don't be suprise.<br/>the absence of elevator was not an issue at all for us. ## \\uc704\\uce58\\ub294 \\ud638\\uc2dc\\uc6b0 \\uc5ed\\uacfc 5\\ubd84 \\uc774\\ub0b4\\ub85c \\uc774\\ub3d9\\uc774\\ub098 \\uad00\\uad11\\uc9c0\\uac00\\uae30 \\ucc38 \\uc88b\\uc740 \\uc704\\uce58\\uc600\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.<br/>\\ub610\\ud55c \\uc9d1 \\ucc3d\\uc5d0\\uc11c \\ubcf4\\ub294 \\uc57c\\uacbd\\uc740 \\ucd5c\\uace0\\uc600\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.<br/>\\ud55c\\uac00\\uc9c0 \\uc544\\uc26c\\uc6b4 \\uc810\\uc740 \\uc2e4\\uc9c8\\uc801\\uc778 5\\uce35\\uc73c\\ub85c \\uc5d8\\ub808\\ubca0\\uc774\\ud130\\uac00 \\uc5c6\\uc5b4 \\uc9d0 \\uc62e\\uae30\\ub294 \\ub370\\uc5d0\\ub294 \\ud798\\ub4e4\\uc5c8\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\ub2e4. ## Wow, this apartment could not be more *central.* You are steps from the main railroad station, the main shopping district, the main tourist sights AND a culturally significant space, Largo do Carmo, where the main activities of the Carnation Revolution took place. There's even a great fado bar right across the street.<br/><br/>Martin and his associate Paolo were super accommodating and helpful, check in and out were easy, and Paolo helped us to find a good place to buy tiles. <br/><br/>The views were awesome, they still linger in my mind now that I'm home... sigh. <br/><br/>It was a great little nest for our first time in Lisbon. Great value. ## Excelente localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o, muito limpo, confort\\u00e1vel, silencioso, aconchegante e familiar. Pr\\u00f3ximo de \\u00f3timos restaurantes, pontos tur\\u00edsticos, e transporte p\\u00fablico. Agradecemos ao Martin pela calorosa recep\\u00e7\\u00e3o e por nos ter indicado \\u00f3timos lugares para visitar e fazer refei\\u00e7\\u00f5es. Recomendo a todos. ## The best thing about this house is the location. It is literally 3 minutes walk from the Rossio train station and super markets. The restaurants in the street seemed popular as we always saw a waiting line outside them. The house in itself is on the 4th floor so be prepared to climb quite a few stairs. The view from the kitchen is amazing, perfect to have a cup of coffee in the morning. We were received by Andre who was super friendly and gave us great  suggestions for exploring Lisbon. ## Lugar aconchegante e bem localizado ## Alloggio pulito, tutti i servizi promessi ci sono. Posizione ottima. Andre / Martin molto cordiali e disponibili, anche per messaggio. gli scalini sono tanti ma per la vista che si ha dall\\u2019appartamento ne valgono la pena! ## This apartment is in the perfect location for a Lisbon stay.  You need to be prepared for stairs.... lots of them, but the climb is worth it.   The welcome was fantastic and we found things easy to manage.  The square at the top of the street was a great place for a drink or a meal.   We would recommend this place to others. ## L'appartement est tr\\u00e8s fonctionnel et parfait pour y passer quelques jours. Nous avons appr\\u00e9ci\\u00e9 la belle vue pour les petits d\\u00e9jeuners. La gare Rossio est juste \\u00e0 c\\u00f4t\\u00e9. Il y a \\u00e9galement un petit supermarch\\u00e9 \\u00e0 quelques minutes \\u00e0 pied. Paulo nous a tr\\u00e8s bien accueillis. Il a \\u00e9t\\u00e9 tr\\u00e8s sympa, arrangeant (vol avec 2h de retard...), disponible et nous \\u00e0 donner des conseils et recommandations utiles. Nous recommandons ce logement! ## At our arrival at the appartement, we met Martins colleague Paulo, he explained and showed us the appartement and he was super kind.<br/>The appartement is super located. You're quickly in the centre. So many restaurants near the appartement. You have a small balcony around the appartement and you can see the appartement. <br/>Our stay was amazing and I will definitely recommend this appartement, who wants to visit Lisboa. ## L'appartement est parfaitement situ\\u00e9 pour profiter au maximum de la ville.  Le quartier est tr\\u00e8s sympa. Vous trouverez un bar \\u00e0 fado tr\\u00e8s bien dans la m\\u00eame rue. A relouer sans h\\u00e9sitation. ## Perfect location. In the very heart of Lisbon. Impeccable cleanliness. Friendly and kind staff. ## Apartamento com excelente  localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o e limpeza impec\\u00e1vel.  Os respons\\u00e1veis  pelo im\\u00f3vel s\\u00e3o  muito acess\\u00edveis  e simp\\u00e1ticos. ## Perfect little apartment in a great area! We loved the proximity to the Carmo square that was always lively. ## Super appartement, tr\\u00e8s bien situ\\u00e9 dans le Chiado (nombreux restaurants et bars \\u00e0 proximit\\u00e9, centre historique facilement accessible). Vue magnifique sur la ville et le ch\\u00e2teau depuis la cuisine, beaucoup de charme de l\\u2019appartement lui m\\u00eame ! <br/>L\\u2019accueil \\u00e9tait \\u00e9galement parfait, nous avons re\\u00e7u de nombreux conseils pr\\u00e9cieux et que nous avons pu d\\u00e9poser nos bagages facilement. <br/>Je recommande fortement ! ## L\\u2019appartement est tr\\u00e8s bien plac\\u00e9 en centre ville. Il est bien insonoris\\u00e9 et bien \\u00e9quip\\u00e9. Nous reconseillons vivement cette location. ## Our stay was wonderful! Check in went very smoothly, we were met and were given loads of local tips that didn\\u2019t say in Lonely Planet. The apartment is located beautifully and centrally and is close to everything! Would love to stay there again! ## Enjoyed our stay, great communication, clean place, good location and appreciated their hospitality ## Todo muy bien! ## Martin's appartment is cosy and friendly, with a top location in Lisboa center. Thanks for the hospitality and the information provided. Highly recommended! ## Luminous charming apartment. Awesome views and location and gentle host. Some details can be improved though, like a deep clean from time to time, repair the bathroom furniture  (broken legs and  not fixed to the wall  so it  felt 2  times during our stay) and a couple of nice wine glasses would be cool also. ## O apartamento \\u00e9 muito bem localizado, limpo e atendeu perfeitamente as necessidades da nossa fam\\u00edlia (casal e uma filha de quatro anos). As vistas s\\u00e3o incr\\u00edveis e a recep\\u00e7\\u00e3o com o Andr\\u00e9 n\\u00e3o poderia ser melhor. A \\u00fanica desvantagem para alguns pode ser os quatro lances de escada, mas que n\\u00e3o nos incomodou. Obrigado pela oportunidade. ## Terrific place to stay in Lisbon! Apartment is sparking clean and in a great location. Would absolutely stay here next time. ## Apartamento charmoso e muito bem localizado! Linda vista!!! ## Excellent personal service. Great location with direct view on the castle. Very close to Rossio Station and middle in the town. ## Charming, sunny, and a perfect location. The lay out is wonderful. The walls are 2 to 3 feet thick and there are windows everywhere.  The location couldn't be better--just a block from the Rossio train station for an easy day trip to Sintra. Easy walking to all the great historical neighborhoods, shopping, and restaurants. Great street entertainment a couple blocks away. Two marvelous health food supermarkets nearby. And the best views in the city. ## Zelden zo een goede ontvangst en uitleg gekregen bij aankomst. Appartement is op de 4e verdieping, zonder lift maar als je in Lissabon wat rondwandelt raak je snel getraind op korte tijd want het is er veel op en neer. Het appartement voldeed aan alle verwachtingen . Flesje wijn als attentie was ook leuk. Aanrader. ## Tudo absolutamente perfeito, comunica\\u00e7\\u00e3o, check in, comodidades, dicas locais, localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o, enfim, Lisboa fica ainda mais fascinante  hospedando-se aqui.<br/><br/>Ao caro Andr\\u00e9, muit\\u00edssimo obrigado pela recep\\u00e7\\u00e3o e por toda a aten\\u00e7\\u00e3o nos detalhes! ## Localiza\\u00e7\\u00e3o \\u00f3tima, espa\\u00e7o super legal. Preparem-se para as escadas! ## Perfect location for this appartement, everything's close (restaurants, bars, shops... ). we had a great time in Lisbon. I'll recommend this appartement ! Martin is very nice, he gave us lot of informations. Thank you \\ud83d\\ude0a ## This apartment is stunning. With many windows overlooking the city, it\\u2019s a lovely and light place. It\\u2019s in a great and central location. We lived there for a month and it felt like home. There were some minor things that were inconvenient, the Wi-Fi being the biggest issue. But overall we really loved the space and Martin is a wonderful and responsive host. ## Martin\\u2019s place was perfect, really central location with good amenities nearby, beautifully decorated and well stocked with everything you might need when you\\u2019re away. <br/>It was great to meet Martin for check in, he showed us everything in the flat and gave really helpful suggestions of things to do and see. <br/>We had a great time staying in Lisbon and would highly recommend this air bnb. ## This apartment is great! It\\u2019s in the perfect place to get pretty much anywhere and has great bars and restaurants all around. The views are great and the plaza is great. ## Amazing views from the flat and the host was very helpful. ## Great place in Lisbon! Best location, well - equipped apartment, fast and efficient check - in. Many restaurants, shopping and historical sights within easy walking distance. Highly recommended for your stay in Lisbon! ## What a bright, spacious apartment in an amazing location. Close to many great restaurants, cafes and bars. And very close to the metro, making exploring Lisbon very easy. The wine and pastries were a nice touch as well. Would stay again! ## Fabulous location with quality service and a space you'll be remiss to leave.<br/><br/>Night life noise might be a bit much for some but 5th floor location helps with the quiet (even if it means climbing stairs to come and go). ## Muito obrigado! Foi inesquec\\u00edvel! ## Beautiful stay in a great location- would very much recommend. ## Great space and host! ## Truly one of the best Airbnb\\u2019s I\\u2019ve ever stayed in. Very clean. Well equipped with washer, full kitchen, beautiful bathroom, Living room, and separate bedroom. Stunning balcony and views. PERFECT location in the city. We would go out for a meal and come home to take a nap without wasting any time. If you get this stay you\\u2019ll be very lucky. ## Cute little spot in a great location. As everyone says, the view is incredible. Also very thoughtful personal touches by the host. Would definitely recommend. ## Amazing place, amazing location, would 100% return!! ## We had a wonderful stay at Martin's. The apartment is in a great location. Close to sights and metro station. Check in was very smooth and we were greeted with lovely local gifts for our stay. It is very well equipped with a full kitchen and living space. One thing to note is that it is on the 4th floor of the building and up 4 flights of stairs. ## We had a lovely stay with Martin. The apartment is in an amazing location, with quick access to great bars and areas of interest in Lisbon. It is lovely and bright, and was clean and tidy on arrival. When it is particularly hot it can get a little stuffy, but there are fans in the apartment that work really well. It is on the fourth floor which means there are a few stairs but you also get a great view over the city. We had a great stay and would book again if we are back in Lisbon. Thank you Martin! ## Martin \\u00e8 un host preciso, cordiale e discreto, ci ha saputo dare buoni consigli sul nostro soggiorno in base alle nostre esigenze, la casa \\u00e8 molto accogliente in una bella posizione centrale e le sue infinite rampe di scale ripagano pienamente la vista che offre. <br/>Grazie ancora da Luca e Barbara ## Martin's Airbnb was a wonderful find. Gorgeous place and very central to all of Lisbon - especially close to the historical downtown and the Chiado neighborhood.We loved our stay. <br/>Be warned: Its 70 steps of stairs. Think of this Airbnb as heart healthy with a wonderful area view. We are at Duques across the street twice and lived it! ## \\uc704\\uce58, \\uccad\\uacb0, \\ud638\\uc2a4\\ud2b8\\uc758 \\uce5c\\uc808\\ud568 \\ubaa8\\ub450 \\ucd5c\\uace0!<br/>\\uacc4\\ub2e8 5\\uce35\\uc774\\ub77c \\ud798\\ub4e4\\uc5c8\\uc9c0\\ub9cc \\ubdf0\\uac00 \\ub2e4\\ud588\\uc74c\\u2661 ## My boyfriend and I LOVED staying at Martin\\u2019s apartment. The view is breath taking and the location was in the perfect spot. Lisbon stole our hearts and I give credit to the location. Would absolutely stay here again! ## Our first time in Lisbon and the location could not have been better. Within easy walking distance of all the sights but nicely tucked away from the direct hustle and bustle. Convenient also for the train to Sintra.. the station is just a couple of minutes walk. The apartment is ideal for a couple. Good space, comfy bed, well equipped kitchen, very quiet. Catarina met us on arrival and was really helpful and informative. All in all a great place. ## The apartment has a nice view and is perfectly located for tourists. It was also very clean and even some fresh flowers were provided. I also found it very welcoming that a little welcome-package was provided with wine, bottled water & pastel de natas. There are just 2 things that we would critize: The bedroom is advised with a doublebed. However the bed must be something around 1.20m broad with only one blanket. For a couple like us that is used to at least 1.80m (and each their own blanket) it was not possible at all to get a good nights sleep in the bed together, which is why my partner slept on the couch for our whole stay. The other thing we missed were at least 1 or 2 more towels. Overall it is a great apartment and if you dont mind small beds its a perfect stay. Keep in mind however that the apartment is located on the fourth floor without an elevator. ## Super Apartment! Perfekte Lage. Gerne wieder ## Martin\\u2019s place was so wonderful and we would absolutely stay here again! It is even better than the photos, right in the middle of everything, with gorgeous views all the way up to Castelo de S\\u00e3o Jorge. There are quite a few stairs up to the place but it is well worth the extra walk up! Martin made the extra effort to meet us for check in, show us the place, and give many local recommendations for food and things to do. We particularly loved the location, as it was very central to everything we wanted to see but high above the street noise, with a more residential feel. <br/>We are already talking about when we will return to Lisboa, in part because of our experience staying at Martin\\u2019s place.

            "Thank you very much Antonio ! All has been perfect during our stay, and the appartment is perfectly located in your fabulous city. We would love to visit you again next time :)_x000D_<br/> ## Very nice appartment in the old town of Lissabon, quite central but still calm in a small lane. No traffic noises etc.! There was enough space for 6 people, everything was clean, kitchen full equipped. Nice contact with the owner. Recommended! ## When travelling we're looking for kids friendly places to stay, and Antonios place was such a place. It's spacious and well equipped._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>He's friendly mother was at the apartment to greet us and she had made ready a baby bed, a high chair and bought cookies,fruit and buns. Very nice._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>The apartment had a hint of damp smell upon arriving, but after we have had the heaters on for some time it disappeared. So stay in the apartment for more than 15 minuttes._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>The neighborhood is nice and we found good restaurants, shops and playgrounds nearby._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>I'll recommend the apartment  ## We've been in Lisbon in march 2013 (3 adults and 3 children). The house is big and comfortable. It is well located in a quiet area very close to Bairro Alto and to Chado; there is also a private outdoor area that could be very pleasant with nice weather. ## Our host Antonio was very helpful with information about Lissabon. He picked us up from the airport :) was great! Real big apartement. We actually didn't use the living room - as we left after breakfast, what we enjoyed in the garden. Perfectly situated in the Barrio Alto. Although very closed to bars & restaurants its still quiet. Disadvantage was that you couldnt leave the window open while sleeping - the apartement is two steps down from the street and the window is just facing the street. The apartement is clean, just the kitchen is a bit \"schmuddelig\" Also the apartement was not very warm - Stonefloors (heaters are available) Make sure that you have slippers to wear. We enjoyd the stay and can certainly recommend the place! Thank you Antonio! ## Very nice place to be. Large clean apartment._x000D_<br/>Everthing you need._x000D_<br/>Including a nice patio for mornings and nights:)  ## Everything was great!, Antonio and his mother Margarida are very good hosts, and the location of the apartments is perfect to enjoy the city. Highly recommended!! ## A very comfortable, clean and nice flat with a pleasant sunny terrace  in the center of the city. Thanks for the warm welcome; we recommand the Antonio's apartment. ## Séjour idéal, nous avons été  accueillis très chaleureusement. L'appartement est idéalement place, parfaitement équipe  et très propre._x000D_<br/>La petite terrasse le soir fait toute la différence. _x000D_<br/>C'était un voyage en famille mais nous reviendrons très volontiers pour découvrir Lisbonne à deux!  _x000D_<br/>Merci beaucoup à Antonio et à sa charmante maman.  ## I spent Great time at This place  ## Appartement bien situé_x000D_<br/>Terrasse très agréable_x000D_<br/>Appartement spacieux ## We had a great stay in Antonio's Appartment. Antonio was very helpful and answered all questions promtly. The appartment is very big and has everything you need even for a longer stay. We expecially enjoyed terrace. As it was still warm in Portugal it was good that the appartment was on the ground floor and cool. The shower was wonderful  with a lot of pressure. The only drawback of the appartment is the musty smell especially in the kitchen. It was okay when we opend all windows when we were \"at home\". Thank you again Antonio! ## The flat is a lovely space with everything you need and some lovely old character features. Its centrally located but still far enough away from the hubbub of the barrio. They were kind enough to let us shelter there for a few hours until our flight left. _x000D_<br/>Book this one it's perfect shame the weather was so awful.  ## Antonio's apartment was exactly what was advertised. The two bedroom was much larger than needed, but the terrace made it worth wild and the price was awesome. Perfect place for a family or a couple of friends. The location was amazing - very close to the bar scene, but far enough away to get a great night sleep. The only complaint would be finding a cab close to the apartment for when I departed - other than that no complaints. _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>James ## We were  disappointed by the flat. One of the room is very small (6 square meter) with no window and the kitchen was full of ants. We doń´t recommend despite the helpfullness of Antonio and his mother. _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Christophe & Delphine.  ## bel et grand appartement très bien situé dans le bairro alto, mais dans une rue où il est possible de dormir la nuit ! _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>jardin très agréable ## I spent 4 days at Antonio's place, with friends, and I have to say it was amazing._x000D_<br/>Antonio's mother welcomed us the first day: she is a very happy and sweet person, she gave us a lot of good advices and tips, so that we could enjoy our stay as much as possible !_x000D_<br/>The flat is great, and the little patio is amazing to have dinner and drinks, after a long and sunny day. The flat itself is amazing : big, nice and fresh. I think it is probably the first airbnb flat that looks even more amazing in real than in picture !_x000D_<br/>Last, Antonio is a very comprehensive and flexible host, really reactive. _x000D_<br/>I strongly recommend this place for the ones who wants to enjoy a nice stay in Lisbon :) ## Super séjour à Lisbonne et très bel et grand appartement tout à coté d'un quartier qui bouge (mais au calme)._x000D_<br/>Très bon contact avec Antonio._x000D_<br/>Petite précision : wifi de mauvaise qualité... ## Das Apartment ist großartig! Tolle Lage und extrem ruhig obwohl nur wenige Schritte von den Bars und Clubs des Bairro Alto entfernt! António war immer sehr gut erreichbar und hat sich umgehend um alles gekümmert! Würde immer wieder dort wohnen! Sehr empfehlenswert! ## calm and clean apartment in the heart of lissabon._x000D_<br/>Antonio was a great and helpfull host._x000D_<br/>I can warmly recomand Antonios Real Garden apartment ## C'est un appartement très agréable à vivre surtout quand il fait chaud à Lisbonne. Il y a 3 portes fenêtres qui donnent sur le jardin, celui ci est ensoleillé l'après midi. Le salon est très spacieux. L'appartement est situé dans un quartier facile à vivre grâce à ses transports et commerces. L'appartement est joliment décoré, il y manque juste une machine à laver le linge. _x000D_<br/>A savoir, je n'ai pas réussi à me connecter au Wifi... ## Super appartement simple, propre et chaleureux. Nous avons été bien accueillis par la maman du proprio. Idéalement situé ( 3 min à pieds du bairro alto ( bars, restos) 10 min du Chiado, du tram etc.... dans un quartier super tranquille ! Jolie terrasse ensoleillée, 2 chambres avec chacune deux lits, grand salon avec 2 canapés-lits, un wc séparé + une salle de bain avec wc. Seul bémol: pas du tout de wifi et le four ne marchait pas. ## Good place to stay ## Clean and spacious apartment. The garden was a big plus.  ## Antonio’s apartment was perfect for our holidays: _x000D_<br/>-You want to have breakfast? You can do it in the garden with the morning sun _x000D_<br/>-You want to visit Lisbon by foot? No problem! All is closed to Antonio’s place, you are very well situated_x000D_<br/>-You want to have a diner,  go out for a drink, a ginjinha or see a fado? Just walk 2 minutes and the Barro Alto is just here_x000D_<br/>-You want to have a rest or sleeping? Not worried, the street is very quiet_x000D_<br/>We really had a great time there and the apartment is exactly what is described. Notice that the wifi works inside and outside, we didn’t have any problem. Antonio’s mother was welcoming at our arrival and Antonio was very flexible for the check-out… In short we recommend this place to visit Lisbon! Thanks again! :)_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/> ## Appartement idéalement situé au plein cœur de Lisbonne, dans une rue calme et proche de toutes les commodités. La terrasse est un atout indéniable.<br/>Cependant l'appartement en lui-même est sombre, la décoration est assez vieillotte et l'isolation n'est pas toujours au rendez-vous notamment si d'autres locataires sont présents dans l'appartement du dessus lors de votre séjour.<br/>Contrairement au reste du logement la cuisine est assez sale mais néanmoins bien équipée. Les chambres sont convenables mais pas de lit double. En ce qui concerne le wifi, on le cherche encore...<br/><br/>Au final : appartement idéal pour un couple voire un couple avec enfant ( à noter qu'il n'y a pas de fenêtre dans la chambre d'enfant...) si la météo est au rendez-vous afin de passer le maximum de votre séjour dehors. Rapport qualité/prix un peu élevé au regard des prestations proposées. ## Great, large apartment in an amazing location! The apartment is super clean and spacious. We loved the back patio._x000D_<br/>Close to good restaurants and shopping!_x000D_<br/> ## Antonio and his french-speaking mother were very helpful all the way. This apartment is a great accommodation that has everything : comfort, location, space, wifi and a private backyard ! The fact that you can get a quiet sleep 5 minutes away from the noisy Bairro nightlife is decisive. ## The apartment and the location were v comfortable for our needs ## Nous avons passé un très bon séjour chez Antonio, l'endroit est très calme, l'appartement grand, au printemps-été et à l'automne, avec le jardinet, cela doit être encore mieux ! ## Io e mia moglie abbiamo trascorso un soggiorno fantastico a Lisbona e di sicuro l'appartamento in cui abbiamo alloggiato ha contribuito notevolmente a rendere questa esperienza molto gradevole. L'appartamento è davvero molto bello e curato nei minimi dettagli; il fiore all'occhiello è sicuramente il patio (purtroppo nel nostro caso il tempo non era eccezionale, ma in caso di bel tempo passarvici alcune ore di riposo dopo un lungo tour della città può rivelarsi un'ottima scelta). Una delle caratteristiche principali dell'appartamento è il fatto di trovarsi in un quartiere (Bairro Alto) centrale, molto caratteristico e pieno di vita (molti ristorantini caratteristici davvero meritevoli con prezzi contenuti- soprattutto rispetto agli standard italiani - e moltissimi locali). Nonostante la vicinanza a tutte queste attività (solo un paio di minuti a piedi), l'appartamento si trova in una via molto tranquilla, priva di rumori. L'host è stato molto cortese nell'accoglierci e nel mostrarci le caratteristiche della casa.  ## Beautiful apartment in an old building, nicely located and with a charming courtyard; Antonio and his family are very friendly and willing to make pleasant your stay in Lisbon. I'm sure I will come back with some friends. ## We had a  thoroughly enjoyable time in Lisbon made especially great thanks to Antonio's hospitality and beautiful apartment. The location of the apartment is great - right in the heart of Barrio Alto but quiet enough to relax and have a peaceful nights sleep. <br/>We had issues upon arrival with the wifi however Antonio responded quickly and replaced it for us. He went out of his way to make our stay memorable, even helped us book our cab to the airport. <br/>We would have no issues whole heatedly recommending the apartment to others.  ## It was a bit complicated to get un and out of the apartament, mainly because of the hill (which ment narrow streets and stairs). But the house is worth it, with a nice garden to have breakfast and comfortable beds. Also they have portable WiFi, that can be really useful to go around the city. A great experience!  ## We stayed in Principe Real Garden Apartment in Lisbon in july. Because we were travelling with a three year old we were looking for a place that was centrally located, had two seperate bedrooms and a garden and Antonio's apartment fit our requirements perfectly. The apartment is very spacious, clean and cool in summer. The garden was a  big plus. ## Everything was just perfect. The appartement was beautiful and the terasse amazing. Antonio and his mother helped us with all our questions and were great hosts. The area was the best you could choose when staying in lisbon, many really great restaurants, shops and parks just a few minutes by feet. We will definitely come back.  ## Wow we had a great time in Lisbon!  And the experience in the apartment of Antonio made it complete. The hospitality by Antonio and his mother was exceptional! The apartment is authentic, spacious and in a very nice neighborhood. We loved the garden!!_x000D_<br/>So many many thank u's!!  ## The apartment is perfectly located in a nice and quiet street in Principe Real (definitely our favorite area) and very close to other neighborhoods like Bairo Alto and the riverside. It's a very good base for your stay on Lisbon.<br/>The lovely old town house apartment is clean, very spacious and cool, together with the garden it's refreshing in the hot summer. Their is absolutely nothing wrong with the apartment. And most important, we had good nights of sleep (quite new IKEA beds with (basic) spring mattresses). The only minor downsides are the little bit outdated kitchen (although Lisbon has very good restaurants and we enjoyed dinners outside) and the apartment can be somewhat humid (ventilating the house before going to bed and keeping the bedroom door a little open solved this minor issue). <br/>A very nice extra is a portable 4G modem which you can take with you throughout the city to give access to internet when needed!<br/>We would definitely recommend the Principe Real Garden Apartment and book this place again when visiting Lisbon! ## Sí era correcta. La ubicación adecuada ## Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour entre amis dans l'appartement d'Antonio. Celui ci a beaucoup de charme, est fonctionnel, propre et idéalement placé dans le centre de Lisbonne (proche des restaurants et bars tout en étant dans une rue très calme). Nous avons également beaucoup apprécié la terrasse de l'appartement. Un grand merci pour l'accueil chaleureux et la disponibilité d'Antonio par message !  ## The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. ## Wonderful place to stay, great hosts. Renting Antonio's apartment made our stay in Lisbon spectacular. We arrived to find our original apartment having a little work done but were offered the apartment above which was exceptionally nice. Everything was updated, clean, spacious and had the charm of old Lisbon. The hosts were very helpful with suggestions and even reserving a taxi for our 4.30 am departure to the airport. We will certainly be returning to Lisbon and would without doubt rent from Antonio again. ## The taxi had a bit troubles to find the apartment but arrived in front of the entrance. We were welcomed by Antonio's mother who had to wait for us as we had a 2 hours delay with our flight. There were some problems with water coming out of the wall and we were kindly offered another apartment. But we wanted to stay at the ground floor as we wanted to enjoy the lovely patio to be outside in the evening. The leakage was not that bad and not bothering us at all. Antonios mother had to leave to arrange things for this with the insurance so we had a brief tour around the apartment in wich we immediately felt at home. There was a change of furniture, so it was a bit different then on the pictures but instead we had a great lounge instead of a couch.  ## We had a lovely time in Antonio's apartment. Such a nice quiet place in a lovely area in the middle of the city centre!<br/>Will definitely come back to this place. Many thanks. ## This time I booked this beautiful appartement for my parents, after me and my boyfriend stayed there in june. They absolutely fell in love with this place. This holiday was one of the best during the last few years. They loved the location in the centre of lisbon, the restaurants nearby, the beautiful garden and the wonderful hosts Antonio and his super great mother, who helped them with all their questions. Our whole family will soon come back to this wonderful place. ## It is a well located, clean apartment with a small and lovely yard. Antonio and his mother were very kind and helpful hosts. The apartment is darker than on pics but, if you whole day away, it is ok. They give us a portable 4G modem, which you can use everywhere in Lisbon, so it was a highlight! _x000D_<br/>Thank you for everything!_x000D_<br/> ## Antonio's mother met us and made us feel welcome right away. The flat itself  is very well located and comfortable. It is close to the attractions of Principe Real and Bairro Alto but tucked away in a quiet street so is very quiet and restful to be in. Antonio provided us with a portable WiFi router so we were able to keep up with emails etc, which we really appreciated. The little garden is a nice suntrap so good for breakfast or an an afternoon drink. The flat is clean, well-equipped and very reasonable. I will definitely be staying here again! ## Het welkom door de moeder van Antonio was hartverwarmend. Na een rondleiding door het huis heeft ze ons met haar eigen auto naar een restaurant gebracht zodat we niet 's avonds laat al op onderzoek uit moesten. Het appartement is prima en het is een leuke buurt met 's avonds veel uitgaansleven. Taxi's zijn spotgoedkoop, dus ondanks dat het erg heuvelachtig is, is Lissabon goed te doen. Het is een prachtige, enerverende stad, we komen zeker nog eens terug.  ## Nous avons séjourné 6 jours à Lisbonne dans cet appartement. Dès notre arrivée nous avons très bien était accueillis par la mère d'Antonio._x000D_<br/>L'appartement est conforme aux photos, dommage que nous n'ayons pas pu profiter du jardin à cause du temps._x000D_<br/>Le quartier est très sympathique avec des commerces, des restaurants et des bars. _x000D_<br/> ## Our welcome to the apartment was good, everything explained. ## Antonio's mother welcome me at my arrival._x000D_<br/>I was very surprise because the appartment is large and have a big terrasse very confortable to have a drink or eating outside._x000D_<br/>A really lovely and typical place in the best neighbourhood for me. After 5 times i always happy to stay in Principe Real._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>The appartement was clean and all you need is there._x000D_<br/>Good service and communication with Antonio and his mother is lovely._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>I highly recommend this palce._x000D_<br/> ## Très agréable séjour dans l'appartement rez de jardin, très bien situé d Antonio. Belle décoration, ménage fait à fond, accueil chaleureux. Nous étions 5 amies et en avons bien profité, ## Great location, spacious apartment. ## This is a spacious flat in a quiet residential area but an easy walk to shops, restaurants and interesting places. The beds were comfortable, kitchen well equipped and plenty of seating. It was nice to have the outside garden area. Modern and interesting decor. Lots of candle to light in the evening. _x000D_<br/>Antonio's aunt was there to meet us and show us around. When there was a small problem, Antonio was round straight away and sorted it.  ## Antonios apartment is in a really nice spot in a lovely and hip area of Lisbon with a park and playground just around the corner. And some very nice restaurants form oldschool (Tascardoso) to cosy and young local kitchen (Taberna Portuguesa) to hip newschool (A cevicheria). It has everything you need and the street it's located in is very quiet. The outside area is great to spend the evenings when you can't get out because of kids or so. Just one thing. Don't try to get there with a car. Parking is almost impossible ;)<br/><br/>Recommended by experienced airbnb family travelers. ## The place is spacious and the architecture beautiful.  We arrived a day and a half late and late at night.  Antonio's family met us and had bought us breakfast foods knowing we were arriving past midnight.  Everything was fabulous except that WiFi was not working (from other comments it seems it usually works) and Antonio was out of town and his mother did not know how to fix; it was also cold in late March.  The space heater in each room needs to stay on even when you are not there as the walls are a couple feet thick (probably keeps the place cool in the summer).  Patio nice, living room large, kitchen had everything.  Go up the hill, to the right and you are on Misercordia which takes you straight into Barrio Alto and Chiado with steps or elevator into Baixa (el Centro).  Excellent restaurants nearby.  A beautiful mirador looking over the city just a few blocks away (up the hill, turn right, go 3-4 short. blocks).   Antonio's family was very helpful.  His mother made fado/restaurant reservations for us in her name at Sr. Vinho, and recommended excellent restaurants (including Bairrio del Avillez), ways to get around (Tuk-tuk from Placa Figueira to the Castel) and places to go.  Lovely. ## I have stayed at this property multiple times and it always delivers as a clean, comfortable, central base from which to visit Lisbon. Antonio and his mother are very helpful and hospitable, and the area is quiet despite being so central. In a city that is changing so quickly, it is a pleasure to stay somewhere that is not done up to please tourists, but which retains the feel of a family home. Thank you! ## Una estancia muy agradable. La localizacion perfecta, silencioso y centrico a la vez. La casa es sencilla pero muy acogedora y eapaciosa. Volvería a alojarme aquí sin dudar. El wifi portatil es un gran punto a favor. ## Thank you so much for everything, perfect location and apartment. We'll definitely come back! Hopefully ;) ## This is a gem of an apartment with a breezy, quaint patio perfect for having a glass of wine and catching up with a group of friends. Well-stocked kitchen appliances, plenty of towels and even a map with recommendations! Antonio was a gracious host who accommodated our early check-in since our planes got in early.  ## The location is quiet but very close to many restaurants, bars and crocery stores. We did not meet Antonío in person but his super friendly aunt managed our check-in and check-out. She even came back afer check-out b/c I left something in the apartment. Communication with Antonío was very easy and I would totally recommend to stay here. ## This is a great apartment for some peace and quiet. The taxi that dropped us off had a hard time finding the street and he just dropped us off at a corner. A woman in a nearby store informed us we were only three blocks away. Antonio's mother met us early and allowed us to check out late. She was super nice! The apartment is close to Bairro, Alto, which would be great dor a couple without children.  It wasnt really ideal for small kids. FYI, invest in a good stroller to navigate the cobblestone streets and hills. Over all, we loved Portugal! ## We had a great stay at this appartment. There is plenty of space, a nice patio and kitchen with all supplies that you need including tea/coffee. It is in a quiet little street so no noise but very close to all the nice bars and restaurants of bairro alto. Great place! ## This is the second time that I've spent holidays at Antonio's appartment. Always very nice ! The appartment is very well located and we had a very warm welcome from Antonio's family. The appartment is spacious, clean and very pleasant to live (very nice terrace). You can go there the eyes shoted ! ## This house is just simply amazing. Its big, clean, romantic, the location; though it's situated close to the 'bar-area' its quiet during the nights.. Everything you can wish for in a residence.  <br/>Also António and his aunt where very nice people! Would def. come back ## A spacious, very well located appartement. It is close to the old centre of Lisbon, right in a lively borough. At the same time, the house is in a quiet street, and a good night’s sleep is hence guaranteed. The apartment is very clean, well equipped, with solid WiFi. The garden is nice. The host has been responsive and very helpful. In short, a very good place to stay for an exploration of lovely Lisbon. ## La casa è in un'ottima posizione, fuori dal caos notturno del centro storico, anche se ci sono locali molto intimi e riservati. La casa è accogliente, i bagni sono nuovi. La pulizia era eccellente. Ottima per famiglie o amici in viaggio. ## Second trip in this apartment where we feel more like in a little country house actually with its courtyard and cosy atmosphere. We love the place and will definitely come back... again! ## I had an amazing stay, conveniently located in the cool Principe Real area and a short walk to the Bairro Alto. Spacious clean with an outdoor area. I would have made more use of the outdoor area if it didn't rain for half my stay. Can't give Antonio and his Aunt enough praise for their hospitality.. 5 stars ## Appartement grand,mais très humide !équipement,le strict minimum.l'appartement est surement plus agréable,mais seulement l'été. ## Amazing location, perfect for families. We loved the outdoor area to have breakfast in the morning.<br/>The place was spotless with plenty of towels. <br/>One very very small comment, as it is an old (but very well looked after) apartment, it gets quite damp during rainy days. You might need to keep the heating on for a while. ## Carefree stay. Good towels, dishwasher, and typical tile interior. ## A great stay! The place is very large with great amenities. Location was perfect - close to the centre of the city and Bairo Alto with great restaurants and night life, but just far enough to be quiet for a good night’s sleep. Fantastic hospitality. ## Great location and quiet too. Recommend ## Lovely apartment, walkable distance to everywhere, excellent bars and restaurants just a stone’s throw away. Great living space with a lovely sunny terrace and living room, and a fully stocked kitchen including an iron which we were delighted with! Thank you for a great stay. ## I would highly recommend Antonio's lovely abode.  He and his family are very hospitable.  The place is exactly as described and so charming.  The terrace is especially lovely and we spent many mornings and evenings enjoying the lovely Lisboa weather.  Also, it is a very comfortable and well located house.  Thank you so much for making our experience amazing! ## The flat did not meet our expectations, there is a strong odor of mildew and it has a huge damp issue.<br/>The apartment was superficially cleaned, everytime I moved the forniture to use the electricity plug I'd find lots of old dust.<br/>The place looks very sad and had very old and damaged forniture.<br/>The lady that welcomed us forgot the keys so as soon as she arrived she left and we had to wait for her for 20 minutes (my mother is 73 years old and on that day we had a long journey from Porto). The same lady checked-in a group of tourist that night at 23:30 making a lot of noise and talking and laughing very loud without thinking that we might had gone already to sleep. <br/>Months before, Antonio promised us we could leave our luggage at his office on our check-out day and that was located in the city centre. <br/>It was nice of him, unfortunately during our stay we found out that it was not in the city centre at all and that was very badly connected so we were forced to pay a luggage hold at the station.<br/>Also, nobody ever contacted us to ask if everything was ok.<br/>It is not worth the expensive price we paid. ## Very lovely and big apartment with a nice patio outside and Well equiped kitchen. Two bathrooms (1 with shower) which was very convenient for us 3 girls :) Situated in a nice area of Lissabon, just a few minutes by foot away from restaurants and shops in Chiado and Baixa. Very friendly and quick communication with our host Antonio. We loved our stay!! ## Very nice apartment, perfect position (near bars and cafes but not in a noisy street), everything very clean and very easy check-in. <br/>The patio is the true gem.<br/>We loved it!  ## We loved the conveint location of this apartment, easy walking distance to shops, cafes, and restaurants. The space is perfect for relaxing with family and friends. The Patio was a highlight, perfect for morning coffee and evening drinks. From start to finish a fantastic place to stay!!! ## La casa es una casa muy vieja reformada y en buen estado pero que curiosamente no tiene TV. La ubicación es buena solo si uno quiere aprovechar el Bairro Alto (de noche), para el resto es incómodo para llegar por las colinas de Lisboa, más aún con equipaje. Los ambientes son muy amplios y cómodos con un bonito jardín. Es una buena opción para aprovechar el Barrio Alto (de noche obviamente) ## We had a great time staying at Antonio's place. The location great, the place was spotless, the outdoor terrace was certainly nice. We would go back here again next time we are in Lisbon for sure. ## What an amazing apartment! It is huge and can accommodate 6 people - but I was a solo traveler and boy did I enjoy the space. There is a patio in the back,  a spacious kitchen,  great rain shower head in the bathroom,  a big living room and extra half bath.  The place is so quiet at night even though it is just a few blocks away from Bairro Alto night life area.  There is a front door which leads to a lobby for another door to the apartment.  There are stairs to the left of the entrance that lead to 2 of his other rented apartments on Airbnb. There is no air conditioner but the stone walls really keep the coolness in. Besides that,  there are 2 tower fans you can use.  The apartment felt safe and well located.  Just like anywhere in Lisbon, you will have to get use to walking up and down hills and stairs. <br/>Antonio was such a gracious host and quick with communication and any help I needed.  He was kind enough to accommodate my very late check in and would send me quick messages to see if I was doing OK.  <br/>I am so happy I chose to stay at his apartment.  For the amount I paid for the space and amenities, it beats staying at a local hotel. Thoroughly satisfied!  Muito obrigado,   Antonio! ## The stay in Antonio's apartment was great. We have hard à very warm welcome by his mother. The location is ideal : in the center and quiet. And the terrace  is lovely (rare in Lisboa center). There isn't air conditioning but wasn't a problem given that the apartment remains cool. I definitively recommend this apartment.  ## Pelas fotos parece ser lindo e na verdade é MUITO lindo! Um apartamento típico e antigo com a decoraçao clean, muito bem localizado no bairro alto pra você se sentir um verdadeiro lisboeta por alguns dias. Dona Margarida mae do Antonio foi um amor, sempre pronta a ajudar. Calmo pra dormir de noite e um quintal com azulejos antigos delicioso. Voltaremos!! ## Beautiful home, lovely and spacious! Would recommend and hopefully we’ll be back one day soon!  ## As ever, Antonio’s place is comfortable, relaxing to be in and he and his family are great hosts. I’ve said this before: you feel you are in a family home and that adds to the experience of staying in Lisbon. It’s not an anonymous venture. I love it! ## Mooi en heel ruim appartement met heerlijke binnenplaats. Wel wat geluid (tv) van de buren maar dat heb je gauw in een stad. Ligging is centraal en vlak in de buurt veel restaurants en barretjes. ## Highly recommended, very clean and situated on a great location (walking distance from Bairro Alto). <br/>All imaginable kitchen appliances are available. Beds are good, not too hard mattresses. The second toilet was a pleasant surprise.<br/>Quick and excellent communication with Antonio. A special thank you to Antonio that we could leave our suitcases at the house before check-in and after check-out. <br/>If we should visit Lisbon again, we would definitely come back here!  <br/>Small side note, when you are with two people but prefer to sleep in separate rooms there is an additional fee of EUR 8.- per day. ## Antonio’s aunt was waiting with the key and quickly got us settled in. The home’s location is ideal. Away from the noise and a close walk to all the lovely areas of the city. It was a bit chilly but we had electric heaters so the rooms stayed cozy. The area is ideal and we would come back again for sure. ## a great place to stay if you like to live like the locals,  great atmosphere, very comfortable, very easy- we will be back ## Big and well located ground floor apartment, a bit expensive for what we found. Quite dark, tidy but not super clean (the floor, the kitchen) and missing some essentials (kitchen knife and chopping board for example). The courtyard and the sun in the afternoon is lovely. ## Fantastic location near to lots of restaurants and bars. António was quick to respond to messages and check in was hassle free. The house had a rustic, charming feel to it - very spacious and comfortable. The garden was an added bonus - a lovely, quiet outdoor space to relax in after a busy day exploring Lisbon. ## We liked the place for it’t location. Close to nightlife and restaurants, but quiet at night. We also liked the garden. Would come again. ## It was already the third time in this place for us and the third time for my parents. The whole family already feels at home. The house is wonderful, the area the best of Lisbon. We absolutely love it and will definitely come back! ## A quiet spacious pad in the middle of a bustling suburb.<br/><br/>Communication was great and any issues resolved quickly, good information at check in. Considering this place is on the door step of everything very quiet and very comfy beds. <br/><br/>Lots of space to hang out and cook everything you need for a family. <br/><br/>Not far from many bars and restaurants. ## A very good accommodation, in a central position very comfortable and large with many spaces. The host Maria was been so nice and ready to give any kind of information or risolve problems. Thank to this accommodation we have a very good time in Lisbon!!! Thank you so much<br/>Elisabetta and Francesco Di Caro, Italy Rome ## Great location, with lovely patio. ## This is a great place and brilliant location. Wonderfully cool in summer ! And Maria and António are very attentive hosts ## Great location, easy walking distance to a couple of gay bars, some beautiful parks, and easy access to both the Bairro Alto and Principe Real neighborhoods. Bring your own toiletries though. ## Lovely apartment and really good location ## Maria is a very friendly host. The place is extremely spacious and the location is amazing. ## Great place to stay! The check in process was so easy and everyone was so kind! Perfect location to walk to all the amazing spots - views, restaurants, bars, etc.. Also, very quiet and safe location! Received quick communication at all times and helped me out with anything I needed! Overall, 5 stars! ## Absolutely lovely flat!<br/> The location is perfect, you are within walking distance of everything. <br/>Maria has great recommendations if you   feel like you are missing out on what's happening in Lisbon. ## Overall this apartment is great value for money! Perfectly located close to everything but on a quiet street. The apartment is very big and the garden is lovely (be prepared that there’s only sun for around 2 hours per day though). <br/><br/>Maria was very helpful and great communication.<br/><br/>Things to consider: there is not a lot of hot water for the shower. The WiFi is not good. The apartment is a bit dark and it smells a bit moldy in the living room (not a problem for me but one of my friends found it uncomfortable). Also note that you have to pay 20eur per night for guests sleeping over.<br/><br/>In spite of that though I would still recommend this apartment and stay there again myself! You won’t find another apartment of this size with a private garden in this area to such a low price in Lisbon! ## Great location where most of the tourist stuff are in walking distance. Great host. She gave some great information for stuff to do, to see or places to eat. Also when we asked for help turning on the heating she helped us right away. Always available and quick responses. <br/>Typical Portugese house. Didn't stay there too much cause we're always in town but it was a fine stay overall! ## I stayed at this property for a month in February and I was satisfied. It is right by barrio alto where all the night life and excitement is, but it's down a hill and pretty sheltered from the noise so I didn't find it loud or anything. <br/><br/>The property is as pictured. A few other reviews mentioned the smell of mildew but I wasn't bothered by any smells. The garden is fantastic. <br/><br/>The location is very walkable to different areas of downtown. <br/><br/>I had some issues at first because I travel with medical equipment and there was a bit of an issue at first, but Maria was one of the best hosts I've had. There was initially some confusion but we worked everything out and she was extremely prompt to respond to all of my problems and concerns. She was very eager to help fix an issue with thw internet when Vodafone the ISP was hacked and everything got shut down.<br/><br/>Weekly cleaning was also included ## Great place to stay in Bairro Alto! Close walk to the popular areas, but the apartment is situated on a quiet street. The apartment itself is spacious and nice. Would stay again! ## Very nice place. <br/>Maria is a great host. <br/>5 of 5 stars! ## Communicatie was super ! We kregen altijd onmiddellijk antwoord op onze vragen en Maria stuurde ons een lange lijst met veel informatie en leuke dingen om te doen in de stad ! Toen we vertrokken heeft ze ook de taxi geregeld die ons voor de deur heeft opgepikt 👌🏻 het appartement is ideaal gelegen , rustige buurt maar vlak bij veel leuke restaurantjes en cafés. Het appartement heeft veel charme maar voelt een beetje verouderd aan. De keuken is oud en ruikt wat muf. Badkamer en slaapkamers waren wel proper ! De koer was ideaal maar ook een beetje verwilderd. Al bij al hebben we enorm genoten van ons verblijf ! ## Maria is a great host, very responsive and friendly. Check-in and check-out worked perfectly. Location of the apartment is great but of course the area can be a bit noisy during night but that's part of the game if you want to stay in Chiado. There was one thing that was not really good, even though there were 2 bedrooms according to the ad only one bedroom was available to us. The 2nd bedroom would only be available for a fee. ## Maria was very responsive and the check-in went smoothly even though we arrived at a late hour.<br/>The apartment has a few important advantages - it is very spacious, it has Portuguese authenticity and has a nice outdoor, and it is in a really calm neighbourhood, not being far from the active places. Do not forget, that Lisbon is a hilly city and there is a lot of climbing up and down. We found really nice cafeteria not far from the apartment perfect for having local breakfast. ## The perfect location and very spacious!!  The street was very quiet and tranquil but a short walk to all neighborhoods. Maria is a sweet host who is proactive in asking sure you know what to expect. She also has a list of great recommendations. ## Cute patio, clean, simple accommodations ## Spacious apartment in a great location, with lots of potential.<br/><br/>Check-in and communication was all very smooth and appreciated. <br/><br/>However there is some hygiene factors that needs serious attention.<br/><br/>There is a lot of black mold in the master bedroom, main bathroom with shower and the kitchen.<br/><br/>The outside space was unfortunately not usable for us. Cigarette buds everywhere and lacked up keep. Did not feel safe with a baby. ## Emplacement parfait et nous avons un accueil très chaleureux. ## Appartement agréable et bien situé. ## Great ! Perfect neighborhood ## Perfect location, patio is fine for breakfast, clean and good communication with Maria and Catarina. ## Very good location but it is an old house. Internet doesn’t work in the bedroom. And could have a TV. ## Maria's place is much more spacious than we expected. The patio is delightful and allows for a nice cool breeze. The location is quite convenient if you are willing to hike up and down the hilly streets of Lisboa. The hosts are quick to respond to queries and were also helpful with arranging a tour. <br/><br/>The house smells of mold - something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to this. <br/><br/>Overall, we enjoyed our stay here. ## The communication was so good and fast. They send a lot of advices for Sightseeing or for visit Restaurants in Lisboa. ## We enjoyed our stay very much. It was pleasant to communicate with Maria. ## Le logement est confortable, bien équipé, bien situé pour un séjour optimal à Lisbonne.<br/>Catarina nous a très bien accuilli a été très conciliante et de bons conseils. ## La casa di Maria si trova nel cuore di Barrio Alto, il quartiere storico della Movida, due passi dalle vie più divertenti di Lisbona dove ci sono numerosi bar e ristoranti ma nonostante tutto è situata in una via tranquilla e silenziosa. A piedi sono raggiungibili le vie dello shopping e le piazze centrali. La casa è adatta per chi ama passeggiare. <br/>L’alloggio è molto spazioso ed ha un giardinetto centrale delizioso.<br/>Maria è un host gentile e disponibile: ci ha fornito moltissime informazioni preziose per godere al meglio di Lisbona. In ultimo, visto che il nostro aereo era di sera, è stata così gentile di farsi restare oltre l’orario previsto del checkout.<br/>Consigliata\n"
